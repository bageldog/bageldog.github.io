Here is a IN-13 nixie tube VU meter I made in 2019. It runs off 12V 0.5A which is stepped up to 140V to power the tubes, and accepts an audio signal from a 3.5mm headphone jack. I ordered the board from an eBay seller and put it using the following schematic:

The first 4 variable resistors adjust sensitivity and gain for the left and right channels, and the last variable resistor adjusts voltage going to the tubes which changes their brightness. 
Here is a video of it in action!
